# Automating Coffee Brewing
Descripton:  Independently developed an automated coffee brewing system with desktop (C/C++, C#) and mobile (Java) applications. Utilized VSCode and Altium for software and hardware design, integrating GPIO,
UART, I2C, and TCP/IP protocols for seamless communication. Produced comprehensive documentation for clarity and accessibility
