# Automating Coffee Brewing
Descripton: In this innovative project, I development of an automatic coffee brewing system utilizing Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers and it can control through an app in desktop. By leveraging the capabilities of these platforms, we created a coffee machine capable of brewing customized coffee recipes with precision and efficiency. Our project involved designing the hardware, programming the microcontrollers, and integrating sensors and actuators to automate the brewing(coffee) process. Through meticulous testing and iteration, we optimized the system for reliability, consistency, and user-friendly operation. This project showcases the power of embedded systems in revolutionizing traditional appliances and enhancing user experience in daily routines.
